## Overview
**Zocket Web Page Summarizer** is a Flask-based AI agent that:
- Accepts a **webpage URL**.
- Extracts textual content from the URL.
- Summarizes the content using **Groq‚Äôs LLaMA 3.3-70B model**.
- Supports **two summarization modes**: Full Summary and Query-Based Summary.

This application is ideal for quickly understanding lengthy articles or webpages, especially for research or competitive analysis.

## Features

### Accept a URL as Input
- Users can input any valid URL via a clean web interface.

### Retrieve and Analyze Webpage Content
- Uses `requests` to fetch the webpage.
- Parses HTML using `BeautifulSoup` and removes scripts, styles, and non-visible elements.

### Extract Key Information
- Extracts visible text line-by-line.
- Cleans and deduplicates the text for accurate summarization.

### Summarize Using LLM (Groq API)
- Uses Groq‚Äôs LLaMA-3.3-70B via `groq` client for:
  - Full summarization (5‚Äì7 bullet points).
  - Query-based summarization (contextual response to a user query).

## Run the Flask Application

1.  Ensure you are still in the terminal or command prompt and in the same directory where the `app.py` file is located.
2.  Execute the command to start the Flask development server:
    python app.py

    or, if you are using Python 3:
    python3 app.py

3.  You should see some output in your terminal indicating that the Flask development server has started. It will typically display a message similar to:

     * Serving Flask app 'app'
     * Debug mode: off
     * Running on [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
    Press Ctrl+C to quit

    This indicates that the application is now running and accessible on your local machine.
